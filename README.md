# Quote Carousel

## Description

This is a mock quote carousel I am building for future projects. The goal is to have a lightweight, smooth testimonials carousel that has customizable animations and is debounced to prevent click spam.

## Technologies

- React
- Styled Components
- Framer-Motion

## Installation

Enter your project directory

`cd project-directory`

Clone the repository

`git clone git@github.com:Personal-Library/quote-carousel.git`

Move into the created directory

`cd quote-carousel`

Install dependencies

`npm install`

## Usage

The user should be able to see a styled quote carousel, which transitions on interval, has buttons to move forward and back, and has smooth animations.
